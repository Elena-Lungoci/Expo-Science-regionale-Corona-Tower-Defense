# Expo-Science-regionale-Corona-Tower-Defense

This is an older version of the game Corona Tower Defense presented at the Expo-Sciences Hydro-Quebec. This version was created in python using the Pygame library, but I am currently working on a new version made with the Unity game engine which can be found here: https://github.com/Elena-Lungoci/Corona-Tower-Defense-Unity
